# forum
A very basic forum I made for my friends to use.

## Code
I pieced this together years ago when I only had a slight clue what I was doing. I used [Slim 3.0](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim). My code isn't the greatest good. 

## Database
Database Schema isn't available yet.  Ask me if you want it.  I used [PHP ActiveRecord](https://github.com/jpfuentes2/php-activerecord) as my ORM.  There are obviously better choices.
